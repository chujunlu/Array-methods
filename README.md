# Array methods

In this exercise, I recreate some of the array methods. The standard is to duplicate as close as possible what the native methods do.

Here are some guidelines: 
- Write down all test cases I can think of 
- Go through carefully if I need them 
- Cut

- Think of examples first 
- Focus on observable behaviors but not implementation

Ask about test cases: 
- Are your tests lying? 
- Are you testing the smallest pieces/Are your tests atomic enough? 
- Are your tests in a sensible order? 
- Do your tests cover edge cases: empty arrays, empty indexes(at the beginning of an array, middle, end), undefined, NaN, null.
